# Hello there my name is Kadu. Welcome to my GitHub profile.


## About Me

With a diverse professional background spanning ERP system implementation, food business management, and a successful book publication on Amazon, I've discovered my true calling in the realm of full-stack development.

My journey into the world of development commenced in 2018, and since then, I've embraced every opportunity that has come my way. Presently, I am focused on architecting microservices for the Tribunal de Contas do Estado do Maranh√£o in Brazil. I leverage my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, and TypeScript to contribute to this endeavor.

Every career step has been instrumental in my growth, imparting invaluable lessons and refining my skills. I am dedicated to employing this diverse knowledge and my unwavering enthusiasm for software development to engineer innovative and resilient solutions.

Keen on collaborative endeavors and perpetual learning, my goal is to lend my experience and commitment to the success of challenging projects. I am always on the lookout for opportunities that foster growth and excellence.
